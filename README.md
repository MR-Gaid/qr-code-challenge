This project is a completed QR Code Component challenge, showcasing responsive web design techniques and best practices.
### Built with

Additionally, I learned how to make an image fit perfectly inside a container, maintaining its full width while ensuring proper responsiveness. These skills have further strengthened my ability to build clean, responsive designs.
